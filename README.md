# Project 4 - *Name of App Here*

**Name of your app** is a basic twitter app to read and compose tweets the [Twitter API](https://apps.twitter.com/).

Time spent: **12** hours spent in total (This was really hard for me)

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can sign in using OAuth login flow
- [x] User can view last 20 tweets from their home timeline
- [x] The current signed in user will be persisted across restarts
- [x] In the home timeline, user can view tweet with the user profile picture, username, tweet text, and timestamp.
- [x] Retweeting and favoriting should increment the retweet and favorite count.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I finally feel somewhat swift competent!! 
2. Woo!!!

## Notes

I had doubts when testing that the retweet function actually worked...sorry twitter followers.
